# EV-Sales-Analysis
Analyzing electric vehicle sales data to identify factors influencing sales drop for Zoom Electric's Sprint scooter model. SQL-based project to provide insights and recommendations for improving sales strategies.


**Electric Vehicle Sales Drop**

**Project Overview**
This SQL project is part of bluetick.ai, with the objective to determine the likely cause for the sales drop of the Zoom electric scooters. The project aims to understand the sudden decline in sales of the newly launched Sprint scooter model and identify potential factors affecting sales.

**Problem Statement**
Zoom Electric (ZE) introduced the Sprint scooter in the electric two-wheeler segment, initially experiencing impressive sales during the first two weeks of its launch. However, sales unexpectedly dropped thereafter. The project seeks to analyze data to find possible reasons for this decline.

**Approach**
The analysis is carried out in two phases:
1. Quantifying the sales drop: Calculating the decline in sales volume over a rolling 7-day period to validate the drop.
2. Comparing sales growth with other scooter models: Evaluating if there is a relationship between the launch date and sales growth in the first two to three weeks.
3. Email analysis: Analyzing the email campaign to assess its impact on customer engagement and overall success.


**SQL Codes**
The project includes several SQL codes to perform different analyses. These codes are:
1. Growth Analysis for Sprint Scooters
2. Growth Analysis for Sprint Limited Edition Scooters
3. Joining Sales and Products Table
4. Summary Table for CTR and Opening Rate for Sprint Scooters
5. Joining Emails, Email_Subject, and Sales Table
6. Email Analysis for Sprint Scooters


**Conclusion**
By analyzing the data and understanding the potential reasons for the sales drop, the project aims to provide insights that can help improve sales strategies and maximize the performance of Zoom Electric's products.


**Findings of the Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis:**
1. Initial Sales Surge: The Zoom Electric's Sprint scooter model experienced impressive sales during the first two weeks after its launch.
2. Sudden Sales Decline: However, there was an unexpected decline in sales after the initial two weeks, leading to a ~20% drop.
3. Impact of Launch Date: Comparing sales growth with other scooter models indicated that launching Sprint in the second half of the year might have affected sales.
4. Marketing Campaign Impact: Email analysis revealed insights into engagement metrics, click-through rates, and open rates, providing valuable information on campaign success.
5. Recommendations: Based on the analysis, strategic recommendations include focusing on launch timing, optimizing marketing campaigns, and identifying potential product improvements to boost sales.
